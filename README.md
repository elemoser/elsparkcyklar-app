## Clone this repository

```
# clone repo with https
https://github.com/elemoser/elsparkcyklar-app.git

# clone repo with ssh
git clone git@github.com:elemoser/elsparkcyklar-app.git

# initiate version control
git init
```

The easiest way to clone this repository is to do so with an SSH key for your account.
If you are unsure whether you have an SSH key already, you can follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys?platform=linux) to check your *~/.ssh* file.
If you do not have a SSH key added to your account yet, follow the steps below:

* [create a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key) 
* [add the key to your account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account#adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-account)
* clone repository with `git clone git@github.com:elemoser/elsparkcyklar-app.git`


## Workflow

We follow a [branch-based workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow). We consider **origin/main** to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state. We consider **origin/develop** to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release. When the source code in the develop branch reaches a stable point and is ready to be released, all of the changes should be merged back into main and then tagged with a release number (ex. v1.0).

**Main branch**
* Only fully tested and approved code is merged into main.
* Only merge code into main from the develop branch.
* Code is merged by means of a pull request, which needs to be approved by a team member.

**Develop branch**
* Develop serves as the integration and testing branch.
* Features and bug fixes are developed in feature branches and merged into develop when ready for integration.
* Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines run on this branch to ensure code quality.


Next to the main and develop branches, our development model uses a variety of supporting branches to aid parallel development between team members, ease tracking of features, prepare for production releases and to assist in quickly fixing live production problems. Unlike the main branches, these branches always have a limited life time, since they will be removed eventually.

**Developement Branches**
* New features, bug fixes and hotfixes are developed in separate feature branches branched off develop.
* Give the branch a short and descriptive name (for example "freature/login-page"). 
* Before merging your developement branch into, create a pull request and ask for code review.

In order to create a development branch for your particular task follow these steps (see below for git):

1. Start a new feature or bug fix by branching off develop.
1. Regularly pull from develop into your feature branch to stay up-to-date with the latest changes.
1. When your feature or bug fix is ready, create a pull request (PR) to merge it back into develop ([how to set up a PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request)).
1. Ask at least one of your team mates to review your PR.
    1. If the code passes the thorpough testing of the assigned reviewer, the PR is accepted.
    1. If the code does needs clarification or does not pass the testing of the reviewer, you will be requested to make changes.
1. Once the PR is accepted by the assigned reviewer, the PR is merged into the develop branch.
1. When no longer needed delete the feature/bug fix branch.
